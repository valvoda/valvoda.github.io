I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon working on AI alignment.

Previously, I was a Postdoc at the University of Copenhagen, affiliated with both the [Danish Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/) and [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/).
Before that, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, under the supervision of [Professor Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/){:target="\_blank"} (Cambridge) and [Professor Ryan Cotterell](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.cotterell.html){:target="\_blank"} (ETH).
During my doctoral studies, I interned at Apple, Amazon, and Google X (The Moonshot Factory).

You can find all my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vLgjEhQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=a){:target="\_blank"}.
