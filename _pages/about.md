I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory supervised by [Professor Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/){:target="\_blank"} (Cambridge) and [Professor Ryan Cotterell](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.cotterell.html){:target="\_blank"} (ETH). My research is on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning with a focus on Large Language Models and legal reasoning.
