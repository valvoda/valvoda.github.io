I'm an Applied Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/){:target="\_blank"} in Palo Alto working on AI alignment.

Previously, I was a Postdoc at the [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/p1ai/){:target="\_blank"}, affiliated with both the [Danish Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/){:target="\_blank"} and [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/){:target="\_blank"}.
Before that, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/people/){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of [Professor Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/){:target="\_blank"} (Cambridge) and [Professor Ryan Cotterell](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.cotterell.html){:target="\_blank"} (ETH).

I have research experience in industry ([Google X](https://x.company/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/){:target="\_blank"}, [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/){:target="\_blank"}) and academia ([University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/people/){:target="\_blank"}, [ETH Zurich](https://ai.ethz.ch/){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/p1ai/){:target="\_blank"}, [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/){:target="\_blank"}).
